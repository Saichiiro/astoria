# 🚀 Final Steps to Production

## ⚡ Immediate Actions (Critical)

### 1. Run Database Migrations
**Run these in Supabase SQL Editor NOW:**

- ✅ `005_add_last_login.sql` - Already run
- ✅ `006_add_users_update_policy.sql` - Already run
- ⚠️ `007_add_active_status.sql` - **RUN THIS NOW** ← CRITICAL

```sql
-- Copy from database/migrations/007_add_active_status.sql
-- Adds is_active column to users and characters
```

### 2. Test Core Features
- [ ] Login → Check last_login updates in admin panel
- [ ] Deactivate a test user → Verify cannot login
- [ ] Deactivate a test character → Verify cannot select
- [ ] Reactivate both → Verify works again
- [ ] Check all admin table pages for readability
